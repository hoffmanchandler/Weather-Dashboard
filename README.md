Created a tool that will accept a city input from the user that will use a third party weather API to return various weather values such as temperature, wind and humidity as well as the user city that they searched for. Could not figure out how to complete the quick select buttons of various popular cities. The weather API also returned a 401 error when trying to grab future 5 day forcast data that could be solved by upgrading to the premium membership. Of course i will not be doing that.
